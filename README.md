# Food-label-and-nutrient-density-classification
The purpose of this project is to classify foods from USDA database using their nutrient content per 100g. Two models were fit- Decision tree using random forests & multi-class neural network. 

**Methods:**  
RF- use nutrient content to predict food label (10 classes made up of food groups). Explore feature importance  
NN- use nutrient content to predict predominant food nutrient (4 classes- protein, carb, fat, or none).  

**Results:**  
RF- 95% prediction accuracy  
NN- 88% prediction accuracy
